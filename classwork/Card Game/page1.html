    <h1>War The Card Game</h1>

    <hr />

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>War is a card game typically involving two players. It uses a standard French playing card deck. The value of each card in decreasing order is: A K Q J T 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2.Due to its simplicity, it is played most often by children.</p>

    <h2>How To Play</h2>
    <p>The objective of the game is to win all cards.</p>
    <p>The deck is divided evenly among the players, giving each a down stack. In unison, each player reveals the top card of their deck – this is a "battle" – and the player with the higher card takes both of the cards played and moves them to their stack. Aces are high, and suits are ignored.</p>
    <p>If the two cards played are of equal value, then there is a "war".Both players place the next card of their pile face down, depending on the variant, and then another card face-up. The owner of the higher face-up card wins the war and adds all four (or six) cards on the table to the bottom of their deck. If the face-up cards are again equal then the battle repeats with another set of face-down/up cards. This repeats until one player's face-up card is higher than their opponent's.</p>
    <p>Most descriptions of War are unclear about what happens if a player runs out of cards during a war. In some variants, that player immediately loses. In others, the player may play the last card in their deck as their face-up card for the remainder of the war or replay the game from the beginning.</p>
    <p>Game designer Greg Costikyan has observed that since there are no choices in the game, and all outcomes are random, it cannot be considered a game by some definitions.However, the rules often do not specify in which order the cards should be returned to the deck. If they are returned in a non-random order, the decision of putting one card before another after a win can change the overall outcome of the game. The effects of such decisions are more visible with smaller size decks as it is easier for a player to card count, however the decisions can still affect gameplay if taken in standard decks.</p>
