    'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br />
    Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<br />
    All mimsy were the borogoves,<br />
    And the mome raths outgrabe.
  </p>

  <p class="verse">
    "Beware the Jabberwock, my son!<br />
    The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<br />
    Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun<br />
    The frumious Bandersnatch!"
  </p>

  <p class="verse">
    He took his vorpal sword in hand:<br />
    Long time the manxome foe he sought --<br />
    So rested he by the Tumtum tree,<br />
    And stood awhile in thought.
  </p>

  <p class="verse">
    And, as in uffish thought he stood,<br />
    The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,<br />
    Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,<br />
    And burbled as it came!
  </p>

  <p class="verse">
    One, two! One, two! And through and through<br />
    The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!<br />
    He left it dead, and with its head<br />
    He went galumphing back.
  </p>

  <p class="verse">
    "And, has thou slain the Jabberwock?<br />
    Come to my arms, my beamish boy!<br />
    O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!'<br />
    He chortled in his joy.

    "It seems very pretty", she said when she had finished it, "but it's rather hard to understand!"<br />
    (You see she didn't like to confess even to herself, that she couldn't make it out at all.)<br />
