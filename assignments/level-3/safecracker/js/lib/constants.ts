      description: "A Henchman will hold off the police while a safecracker continues to work on the safe. A henchman can last anywhere from 1 - 6 turns against the police (generated at the start of the battle), giving the player that many more chances to crack the safe (the seconds on the clock no longer matter). After those turns are up the henchman surrenders and is hauled away. The Henchman will begin battling police as soon as the 3 turn grace period is up and the countdown to each henchman's surrender will begin. If the player has more than one henchman in a bag, they will fight police separately so that only one will be captured at a time. Once all of the henchmen are gone, the player is arrested."
